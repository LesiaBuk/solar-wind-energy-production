### Measurements of solar&wind energy production in France 01.01.2020-30.06.2023

 The purpose of this research is to show how seasonality affects solar and wind power generation, which hours of the day generate more and which less, and whether the generation of both solar and wind power is increasing over time (study period 2020-mid-2023). Since the data on electricity consumption in the market is not known, I am not able to analyze how the government compensates producers for the difference between consumption and energy received, as this may be a problem of electricity excess

 First, using Power Query, I changed the data format, made some corrections to the time format, and then uploaded the table to Tableau Public.
 Next, I made 4 main graphs, combining them into an interactive dashboard - a visualization of the average hourly electricity production for the studied years, months, during the day, and also researched the influence of seasonality on changes in renewable energy generation.

 The following conclusions can be made: wind energy provides more generated electricity, but it is more variable and intermittent. The highest wind energy production is observed in the winter months, the lowest in the summer months. Solar energy, on the other hand, is more predictable. Most solar energy is generated in the summer months, with a peak in June.
